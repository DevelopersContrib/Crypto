Development of Contrib's cryptocurrency


 
# eShares (ESH) ENERGY  
eShares (ESH) will be our official mint cryptocurrency centering on CTBs or contributions
 
 
 
# To do : 
Access the testrpc address via testrpc node
Create a crowdsale for ESH ICO offering on July 30 - test
Create UI for crypto.contrib.com for users who are willing to participate in the crowdsale
 
 
 
 
# eShares (ESH) TOKEN
 
Features of the token: 
The token has a central bank, central admin - in code
The token should allow transfer of eShare from the master wallet to any address or from any address to any address - in code
The token should allow self-minting - in code
The token should allow setting of prices - in code
The contract admin should allow freezing of account - in code
The contract admin should allow transfer of ownership - in code
One ESH should be equivalent to $1 - this can be internal or only on crowdsale
 
 
 

# ORGANIZATION - DAO
 
 
This can be any brand we wish to add to the blockchain. It may not be all domains but those who we just choose in VNOC. 
 
Features of the DAO: 
Dao will print eshares from VNOC/eshares cap table
On eshares they will see how many eshares are allotted to the user
So for eg. on Contrib
 
Todo : 
Need to have an option within domain details to add to block chain
Function to add to blockchain should be created
