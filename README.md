Development of Contrib's cryptocurrency

We are developing two coins for the blockchain, ESH and CTB.

# Contrib Coin (CTB) 
CTB coin is created to reward contributors for any verified contribution on the blockchain.

# eShares (ESH) ENERGY (for development) 
eShares (ESH) will be our official mint cryptocurrency centering on CTBs or contributions
 
 
 
# To do : 
Access the testrpc address via testrpc node
Create a crowdsale for ESH ICO offering on July 30 - test
Create UI for crypto.contrib.com for users who are willing to participate in the crowdsale
 
# CONTRIB (CTB) TOKEN
 
Features of the token: 
The token has a central bank, central admin
The token should allow transfer of CTB from the master wallet to any address or from any address to any address.
The token should allow self-minting.
The token should allow setting of prices.
The contract admin should allow freezing of account.
The contract admin should allow transfer of ownership
One CTB is not equivalent to any digital currency.

# ORGANIZATION - DAO
 
 
This can be any brand we wish to add to the blockchain. It may not be all domains but those who we just choose in VNOC. 
 
Features of the DAO: 
Dao will print eshares from VNOC/eshares cap table
On eshares they will see how many eshares are allotted to the user
So for eg. on Contrib
 
Todo : 
Need to have an option within domain details to add to block chain
